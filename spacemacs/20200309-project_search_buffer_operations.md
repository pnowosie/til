Global search
---

`SPC /` allows to search of the pattern in all project's files.
You also can
- `C-n` / `C-p` - moving down / up in the results buffer
- `RET` - jump to the file to line containing searched phrase
- `SPC r s` - retry the search so no need to search again after jump
- `C-z` - search results to a buffer
  - `F1` - open file (just like simple RET)
  - `F2` - open in new window
  - `F3` - search results in a buffer
  - `F4` - edit search buffer - allows for global search & replace
