* Rebase onto master
  It just works! I'm surprised how ease it went.
  
  - SPC g s - show status
  - r e - rebase (elsewhere), shows available branches
  - pick `master` from the list (ENTER)
  
  No conflicts - all good. Now you can see your rewritten hostory by rebase and "unpulled" hostory at origin. 
  We need to push changes to upstream.

  - P push
  - -F (with force)
  - u (upstream)
