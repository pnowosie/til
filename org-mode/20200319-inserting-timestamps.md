Insert a timestamp

- `, (. or !)` - opens calendar and allows to insert a date active or !-inactive,
   <br/>format: [2020-03-19 Thu] (inactive) 
   <br/>Active timestamp makes agenda link
   
Inserting date and time with calendar selection
- `SPC u , (. or !)` - as above but changes date default format (SPC-u is emacs C-u)
  <br/>format: [2020-03-19 Thu 14:25]

Inserting current date without calendar
- `SPC u SPC u , !` - so here is `C-u C-u` to modify behaviour

Shortcut with calendar selection is quicker (just ENTER to approve)
Also calendar allows for nice trics like
- `+` - add 1 day
- `+3d` - add 3 days
- `-w` - same day week before
- also `m` for a month and `y` a year works as above
