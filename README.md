# Today I learned

[[Spacemacs docs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/doc)]

## Motivation
After a decade long being dotnet person locked in Windows ecosystem I started Ubuntu at work and MacOS at home.
Quickly I discovered that there are many missing tools I used for years, the ported ones have different keyboard shortcuts.
Even my primary editor of choice VS Code has slightly different keys on mac.

I can learn all of this key again, but I cannot train my muscle memory to switch every time I switch the platform.

In this repo I'll keep the things I'm learning. It meant to be usefull for me only, so you're reading this at your own responsibility ;)
