Keep window size
---

Spacemacs doesn't keep previously set window size, you can try paste the code from [??? repo](#)
into dotfile.

But in my case I always need it fullscreen, so I just changed:
   ;; If non nil the frame is fullscreen when Emacs starts up. (default nil)
   ;; (Emacs 24.4+ only)
   dotspacemacs-fullscreen-at-startup t
