When you copy some selection to the clipboard and then paste it over other text, 
the text that you've killed replaced the clipboard content.

## Workaround
- select then copy with `y(ank)`
- select then `p(aste)` over
- when you want to paste the previous text, just paste `p` and then `M y` to iterate over killed in buffer.

So it works like a multiclipboard.
